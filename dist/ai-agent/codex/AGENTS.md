## Top-Level Rules

- **You must think exclusively in English**. However, you are required to **respond in Japanese**.
- To understand how to use a library, **always use the Contex7 MCP** to retrieve the latest information.
- Please respond critically and without pandering to my opinions, but please don't be forceful in your criticism.

## Programming Rules

- Write documentation comments in Japanese for all functions and classes. Write them so that the specifications of the function or class are clearly understood.
- Write self-documenting code that does not require inline comments.
- Only add inline comments when the intent cannot be expressed through the code itself.
- Avoid redundant comments that duplicate what the code already expresses.
- Avoid hard-coding values unless absolutely necessary.
- Do not use `any` or `unknown` types in TypeScript.
